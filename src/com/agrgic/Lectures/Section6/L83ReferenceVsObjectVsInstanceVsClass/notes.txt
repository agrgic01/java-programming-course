no coding, only explanations

analogy of building a house
    a) Class - blueprint for building a house, we can re-use this blueprint to build any number of houses
    b) Object or Instance - each house we build using the "new" keyword
    c) Reference - an address of a particular house, every object has its address AKA reference
                 - we can copy a reference but there is still that same one house
                 - we can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods
