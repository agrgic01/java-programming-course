method overloading
    -providing two or more separate methods with same name but different parameters.
    -method return type may or may not be different, this allows us to reuse the same method name.
    -reduces duplicate code, easier to remember method names.

method overriding
    -defining a method in a child class that already exists in the parent class with the same signature (same name, same parameters)
    -by extending a parent class, the child class gets all the methods from the parent class. (AKA derived methods).
    -put '@override' above the method definition.
    -can't override static methods, only instance methods.

    method overriding rules
        -must have same name and arguments
        -return type can be a subclass of the return type in the parent class.
        -can't have a lowe access modifier.
        -only inherited methods can be overridden,
        -a subclass can use 'super.method()', to call the superclass version of the overridden method
