Arrays Recap

    1.  An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type into a single variable.
    2.  The default values of numeric array elements are set to "0". Default values for boolean array elements is "false".
        Default values for String arrays is "null"
    3.  Arrays are ZERO INDEXED: an array with N ELEMENTS is indexed FROM 0 TO N-1, for example 10 ELEMENTS INDEX RANGE IS FROM 0 TO 9.
    4.  If we try to access index that is out of range Java will give us an 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException',
        which indicates that the index is out of range in other words out of bounds.
    5.  To access array elements we use the square braces '[' and ']', also known as array access operators.
